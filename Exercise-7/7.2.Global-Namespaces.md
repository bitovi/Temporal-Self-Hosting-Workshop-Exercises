# 5.2 Gobal Namespaces
In the last exercise we setup our clusters, now let's see how global replication happens

Run the following in two terminal windows or tabs:

```bash
kubectl port-forward deployment/active-temporal-frontend 7233:7233 --namespace=active
```

```bash
kubectl port-forward deployment/passive-temporal-frontend 17233:17233 --namespace=passive
```

We need to setup our Temporal CLI to be able to reach the passive instance.

Start two terminal windows or tabs, in one run the following:

```bash
export TEMPORAL_ADDRESS="127.0.0.1:17233"
```


Confirm your setup by watching the port forward logs.

Run `temporal operator namespace list` first in the tab we set the TEMPORAL_ADDRESS in, then in a fresh tab

We should see:
```bash
Handling connection for 7233
---
Handling connection for 17233
```

## Check before continuing
Run the following in both windows:

```bash
temporal operator cluster list
```



## Active cluster
Create a new namespace called `active`

### Pause to consider
1. Is the namespace created available in the active and passive?

## Create a global namespace
Create a new namespace called `active_global` and add the global flag

### Pause to consider
1. Is the namespace created available in the active and passive?


## Start a benchmark test

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployments/active-benchmark-deployment.yaml
```

## Open the UI

Run the following in two terminal windows or tabs:

```bash
kubectl port-forward deployment/active-temporal-web 8080:8080 --namespace=active
```

```bash
kubectl port-forward deployment/passive-temporal-web 8181:8080 --namespace=passive
```

### Pause to consider
Look at your passive UI, change your namespace to active

1. Our clusters are now linked! This in part because we've set them up to
