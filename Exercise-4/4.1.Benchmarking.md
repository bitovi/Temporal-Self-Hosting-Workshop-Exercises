# 4.1: Benchmarking
Benchmarking is important to Temporal because it allows the team to systematically measure and evaluate the performance, scalability, and reliability of the Temporal platform. By running benchmarks, you can identify bottlenecks, optimize core components, and ensure the system meets performance expectations for real-world workloads.


In this exercise we are going to work with Temporal's benchmarking tool as it's easy to setup and get things running.

From the project root run the following within a terminal window/tab:
```bash
kubectl apply -f ./benchmark-deployment.yaml
```
This will create two deployments: One that will connect to the Temporal service and act as a worker and the other which will create workflow requests that the first worker will act on.


It may be tempting to only look at workflow success vs workflow failure but this isn't always the case. Temporal is durable and execution often times have retry logic, as a result success vs failure doesn't always tell the whole story of how the Temporal service is performing. This is going to measure the **number of state transitions** which represents Temporal writing to its persistence backend, which is a reasonable proxy of how much work Temporal itself is doing. This is a handy metric to leave up and follow as we continue through this section.

## Exercise cleanup

To ensure our cluster stability let's now reduce the system load to ensure our cluster doesn't run out of capacity.

```bash
kubectl scale deployment benchmark-soak-test --replicas=0;
sleep 2; # We do this to ensure the workload creation stops and the workers can clear teh queue before bringing the worker down.
kubectl scale deployment benchmark-workers --replicas=0;
```
