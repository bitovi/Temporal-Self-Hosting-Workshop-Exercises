# 4.2: Visualizing Temporal metrics and traces

Now that we our within our Grafana UI, it's time to begin dissecting the out-of-the-box metrics, what they represent and how we can interpret them.

## Dashboards Explored

On the left panel, click "Dashboards", you should see the following preconfigured dashboards:

1. Cluster monitoring for Kubernetes
2. Frontend Service Dashboard
3. History Service Dashboards
4. Matching Service Dashboard
5. SDK Metrics
6. Temporal Server Metrics
7. Visibility
8. Worker Service Dashboard

Some of the panels won't have any values yet as we have yet to perform load simulation. We'll discuss what the panel is doing and how we can interpret it here and come back to it in later exercises. 

We'll go through each of this in order of importance starting with [Temporal Server Metrics](./4.2.1.Temporal-Server-Metrics.md)
