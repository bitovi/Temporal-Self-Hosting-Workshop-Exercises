# 4.1: Adding monitoring tools Prometheus and Grafana

Over the last few exercises we've brought our Temporal server up using the kubernetes package manager, Helm, connected to it from the web UI and have created a namespace using the temporal CLI. By all rights, we now have a development ready Temporal cluster that our business could use, but to be production ready we still have a ways to go. It's common for businesses to get this far, begin building workflows on Temporal, recognize the value and scale to quickly!

To begin with, let's bring Prometheus and Grafana up by updating our Helm install:
```bash
helm upgrade \
    --install \
    my-temporal temporalio/temporal \
    --set server.replicaCount=1 \
    --set cassandra.config.cluster_size=1 \
    --set elasticsearch.replicas=1 \
    --set prometheus.enabled=true \
    --set grafana.enabled=true \
    --timeout 15m
```

We will see that the revision of our deployment has increased by 1 and the status should be **deployed**:
```bash
...
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
...
```

If you're still watching your pods with `watch kubectl get pods` you should also see a few new pods start initializing. 
```bash
my-temporal-alertmanager-0
my-temporal-grafana-b8b59bf44-q5nbz
my-temporal-kube-state-metrics-796d7c8d65-xcsth
my-temporal-prometheus-node-exporter-fvpkz
my-temporal-prometheus-pushgateway-d7d4c6dc5-px9bd
my-temporal-prometheus-server-6b7b7ddd45-cgwvb
my-temporal-schema-2-rbbrm
```

There is a lot going on, so while we wait let's break down each part and what they are doing. 

1. my-temporal-alertmanager-0 is the [prometheus altertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) which is responsible for, you guessed it managing alerts
2. my-temporal-grafana will provide us a means of creating dashboards to visualize our metrics
3. my-temporal-kube-state-metrics is a service that listens to the Kubernets API and generates metrics about the state of objects
4. my-temporal-prometheus-node-exporter is a service that collects and exposes kubernetes low level metrics such as CPU and Mem
5. my-temporal-prometheus-pushgateway is a service that exposes metrics for ephemeral and batch jobs
6. my-temporal-prometheus-server is our monitoriing and alerting tool
7. my-temporal-schema-2 is a job that runs and preps our out-of-the-box grafana dashboards


Now that everything is stable, like our webUI and frontend let's expose our Grafana instance. In a new terminal window / tab run the following:
```bash
kubectl port-forward deployment/my-temporal-grafana 3000:3000
```

In a new terminal window / tab run the following:
```bash
kubectl get secret my-temporal-grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode
```

Copy everything up to the `%` character. To login into your Grafana dashboard open a new browser, navigate to the URL `localhost:3000`, enter the username as **admin** and the password as what you copied from the above.

## Exercise Conclusion

By completing this exercise, you have enhanced your Temporal development cluster with robust, production-grade monitoring capabilities. With Helm, you deployed Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting, Grafana for data visualization, and supporting components for detailed Kubernetes and Temporal observability.

**Key takeaways:**

- **Monitoring Foundation:** You now have a dedicated Prometheus instance continuously scraping metrics from your Temporal services and Kubernetes infrastructure.
- **Visualization Readiness:** Grafana is up and running, providing an interactive interface for exploring real-time and historical data about your Temporal cluster.
- **Component Awareness:** Understanding the purpose of each deployed monitoring component—Alertmanager, Grafana, Pushgateway, kube-state-metrics, and Node Exporter which equips you for deeper troubleshooting and future customization.
- **Next Steps:** You know how to securely access Grafana and are ready to begin visualizing Temporal’s rich metric set for deeper operational insight.

**Why This Matters:**
With these tools in place, your Temporal deployment approaches production readiness. Effective observability is critical to scaling with confidence, resolving incidents quickly, and maintaining the health of your workflows and infrastructure as adoption grows.

In the next exercise, you will [explore the Temporal server metrics dashboard](./4.2.Visualizing-Temporal-metrics-and-traces.md), learning how to interpret the data and leverage out-of-the-box panels for operational excellence.
