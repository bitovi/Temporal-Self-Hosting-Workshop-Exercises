# 4. Observability and Monitoring

In this exercise we will add an observability layer to our deployment using Prometheus, Grafana and metrics scrapers. We will explore the out-of-box metrics that Temporal recommends as a minimum setup, add some additional metrics that we think are important, create an alert and finally simulate compute failure.

Let's get started by [adding our observability layer](./4.1.Adding-monitoring-tools-Prometheus-and-Grafana.md)

This exercise will focus on understanding how to understand our Temporal Cluster, how to prep for scaling and how operators can evaluate system performance.
