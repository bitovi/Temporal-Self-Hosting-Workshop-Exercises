# 4. Observability and Monitoring

The focus of the next exercises will be understanding our Temporal Cluster, how to prep for scaling and how operators can evaluate system performance.
We will do this by adding an observability layer to our deployment using Prometheus, Grafana and metrics scrapers. We will explore the out-of-box metrics that Temporal recommends as a minimum setup, add some additional metrics that we think are important and simulate compute failure.

Let's get started by [adding our observability layer](./4.1.Adding-monitoring-tools-Prometheus-and-Grafana.md)
