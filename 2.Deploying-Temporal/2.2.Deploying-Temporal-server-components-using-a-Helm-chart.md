# Exercise 2.2: Deploying Temporal server components using a Helm chart.md
In this exercise we will use Helm to deploy a Temporal service to our local kubernetes cluster. We installed the Helm CLI during [exercise 1.1](../1.Preparing-Your-Environment/1.1.Installing-prerequisites.md). Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, we will use it here to simplify and expidite our workshop but in it is highly recommended that you manage the Temporal deployment more manually in real environments.


First let's add the TemporalIO helm repo to our local helm CLI repo list
```bash
$ helm repo add temporalio https://temporalio.github.io/helm-charts
```

Next we will bring up the cluster.
```bash
$ helm upgrade \
    --install \
    my-temporal temporalio/temporal \
    --set server.replicaCount=1 \
    --set cassandra.config.cluster_size=1 \
    --set elasticsearch.replicas=1 \
    --set prometheus.enabled=false \
    --set grafana.enabled=false \
    --timeout 15m
```

We can watch the deployment using the following:
```bash
## If watch command is available - prefered way
$ watch kubectl get pods
## If watch command is not available
$ kubectl get pods --watch
```

You should see a deployment similar to:
```bash
elasticsearch-master-0                  0/1     Running    0          12
my-temporal-admintools-6d74864f-ntwsl   1/1     Running    0          10s
my-temporal-cassandra-0                 0/1     Running    0          10s
my-temporal-frontend-98599d944-vw4lp    0/1     Init:0/2   0          10s
my-temporal-history-76dc8c9f98-fvpbw    0/1     Init:0/2   0          10s
my-temporal-matching-77b8c45d97-nkm5q   0/1     Init:0/2   0          10s
my-temporal-schema-1-fppxk              0/1     Init:0/7   0          10s
my-temporal-web-f756d58b5-mrblw         1/1     Running    0          10s
my-temporal-worker-7bc65858cb-g6rtz     0/1     Init:0/2   0          10
```


There is a lot going on, so while we wait let's break down each part and what they are doing. 

1. `elasticsearch-master` our visibility store
2. `my-temporal-admintools` This is a pod that has the admin tools, such as **tctl** and the database CLIs like **temporal-cassandra-tool** and **temporal-mysql-tool**. This is used by the schema setup job to prepare the database.
3. `my-temporal-cassandra` our persistence store
4. `my-temporal-frontend` is the Temporal frontend service
5. `my-temporal-history` is the Temporal history service
6. `my-temporal-matching` is the Temporal matching service
7. `my-temporal-schema` is the Temporal schema job that prepares the database for our Temporal service
8. `my-temporal-web` is the Temporal UI
9. `my-temporal-worker` is the Temporal worker service

> [!NOTE]
> It is normal for the frontend, history, matching and worker pods to go into a CrashLoop status while the schema is running.
> DON'T PANIC

## Exercise conclusion
Great job, we now have a running instance of Temporal deployed on our local kubernetes cluster. In the next exercise we will [verify the service deployment](./2.3.Verifying-Temporal-deployment.md)
