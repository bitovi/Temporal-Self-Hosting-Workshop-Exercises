# Exercise 2. Deploying Temporal


In this exercise you will get to know the Temporal architecture, beginning with exploring the 4 core services that make-up the Temporal service and what each of them do. After we understand what Temporal is we will deploy Temporal to our local kubernetes cluster using helm and watch as the services begin using kubectl. Finally we will create a namespace for later exercises.

Let's get started by [Exploring Temporal’s architecture](./2.1.Exploring-Temporal’s-architecture-and-required-services.md)
