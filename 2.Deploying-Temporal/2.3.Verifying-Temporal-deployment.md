# 2.3: Verifying-Temporal-deployment
With our Temporal instance up and running locally we now need to verify the deployment. We've already partially done this in the step before.

Let's start with the easiest means of doing so.. making sure the pods are healthy after a few minutes of running.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                    READY   STATUS      RESTARTS        AGE
elasticsearch-master-0                  1/1     Running     0               8m4s
my-temporal-admintools-6d74864f-kpdnz   1/1     Running     0               8m4s
my-temporal-cassandra-0                 1/1     Running     0               8m4s
my-temporal-frontend-c9c878857-srmt6    1/1     Running     2 (5m59s ago)   8m4s
my-temporal-history-76f7d64f9f-mhtzj    1/1     Running     2 (5m59s ago)   8m4s
my-temporal-matching-58c57fd6b6-wjfqs   1/1     Running     2 (5m59s ago)   8m4s
my-temporal-schema-1-75zvf              0/1     Completed   0               8m4s
my-temporal-web-f756d58b5-wshrc         1/1     Running     0               8m4s
my-temporal-worker-84bcdcf7f7-xj7mr     1/1     Running     2 (5m59s ago)   8m4s
```

| Service | Status |
|-|-|
| elasticsearch | :white_check_mark: |
| cassandra | :white_check_mark: |
| frontend | :white_check_mark: |
| history | :white_check_mark: |
| matching | :white_check_mark: |
| web | :white_check_mark: |
| worker | :white_check_mark: |


Next, let's take a look at the logs that are being produced. Consider what service might be the best to do this with, if needed, refer back to the previous exercise.

The right answer is the frontend. Why? Because most other services speak to or through the frontend, so it's a good place to start.
```bash
$ kubectl logs deployment my-temporal-frontend
```

Let's pick out a few key details. 

```text
TEMPORAL_ADDRESS is not set, setting it to 10.244.0.36:7233 <--the gRPC port we expect
Current reachable members" ... "service":"matching"
Current reachable members" ... "service":"worker"
Current reachable members" ... "service":"frontend"
Current reachable members" ... "service":"history"
Frontend is now healthy
```

Excellent, looks like the frontend is reaching all services as we would expect, and just in case you're wondering, `"service":"frontend"` isn't a mistake, the service did reach out to itself for discovery.

You can of course do this for all the deployments, but I trust that things are okay based on what I see here.

## Exercise conclusion
All systems are go! We have deployed a Temporal service to our local kubernetes cluster, our schema job ran meaning our persistence and visibility stores are prepped for Temporal work and we checked our Frontend logs to ensure things look healthy.


So with that, let's move on our next exercise [where we will connect to Temporal and create a namespace](../3.Initial-Configuration-and-Access/README.md).
