# Exercise 1.1: Installing prerequisites (Docker, kind, kubectl)

## Docker
[Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly

#### Verify the install
Run the following command:
```bash
$ docker version
```

The versions should be at minimum or above:
```bash
Client:
 Version:           28.2.2
 ...
Server: Docker Desktop 4.42.1 (196648)
 Engine:
  Version:          28.2.2
```



## Kubectl and Kind
[Install Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
[Install Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. Kind lets you run Kubernetes on your local computer.


#### Verify the kubectl install
Run the following command:
```bash
$ kubectl version --client
```

The versions should be within at least 1 minor version of the kubernetes cluster, but preferably should be at minimum or above the following versions:
```bash
Client Version: v1.33.0
Kustomize Version: v5.6.0
```

#### Verify the kind install
```bash
$ kind version
```

The versions should be at minimum or above:
```bash
kind v0.29.0 go1.24.3 ...
```

Once you've done this move on to the [next exercise](./1.2.Setting-up-a-kind-Kubernetes-cluster.md).
