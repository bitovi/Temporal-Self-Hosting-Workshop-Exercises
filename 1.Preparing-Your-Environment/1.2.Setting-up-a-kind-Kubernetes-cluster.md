# Exercise 1.2: Setting up a kind Kubernetes cluster

To ensure a safe setup, begin by setting your KUBECONFIG environment variable to a safe file. 

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.kube && touch ~/.kube/temporal-workshop-2025
$ export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/temporal-workshop-2025
```


Create a cluster for us to use on your local machine:

```bash
kind create cluster --name temporal-workshop-2025 --wait 5m
```

This will bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster using a pre-built node image. By default, the cluster will be given the name kind. Use the --name flag to assign the cluster a different context name.

Wait for all the kubernetes services to start successfully:
```bash
 ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.33.1) 🖼
 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦  
 ✓ Writing configuration 📜 
 ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️ 
 ✓ Installing CNI 🔌 
 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾 
 ✓ Waiting ≤ 5m0s for control-plane = Ready ⏳
```

## Exercise conclusion
You now have a Kubernetes cluster running on your local machine. In upcoming exercises we will install Temporal onto this cluster and interact with it using the CLIs we installed in the previous section.

Once you're done, move on to the [next exercise](./1.3.Verifying-your-cluster-and-basic-kubectl-commands.md).
