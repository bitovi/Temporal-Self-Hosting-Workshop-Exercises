# Exercise 1.2: Setting up a kind Kubernetes cluster

To ensure a safe setup, begin by setting your KUBECONFIG environment variable to a safe file. 

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.kube && touch ~/.kube/temporal-workshop-2025
$ export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/temporal-workshop-2025
```


Create a cluster for us to use on your local machine:

```bash
kind create cluster --name temporal-workshop-2025 --wait 5m
```

This will bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster using a pre-built node image. By default, the cluster will be given the name kind. Use the --name flag to assign the cluster a different context name.

Wait for all the kubernetes services to start successfully:
```bash
 ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.33.1) 🖼
 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦  
 ✓ Writing configuration 📜 
 ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️ 
 ✓ Installing CNI 🔌 
 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾 
 ✓ Waiting ≤ 5m0s for control-plane = Ready ⏳
```


Once you've done this move on to the [next exercise](./1.3.Verifying-your-cluster-and-basic-kubectl-commands.md).
