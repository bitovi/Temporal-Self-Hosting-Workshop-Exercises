# Exercise 1. Setup your local environment


In this exercise you will setup your local environment in preperation for the workshop. By the end you will have installed the Docker engine which will be used to build and run our container images, Kind which will be used to create a Kubernetes cluster using your local machine and kubectl which we will use to interact with our local kubernetes cluster.

Additionally you will optionally setup your local machine with a quick start alias that will ease our local development setup as we get into more complex Temporal interactions.

Let's get started by [installing our CLI tools](./1.1.Installing-prerequisites.md)
