# 5.1 Exploring Omes

Clone the Omes repo to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/omes.git;
cd omes;
```

## Omes - a load generator for Temporal
This project is for testing load generation scenarios against Temporal. This is primarily used by the Temporal team to benchmark features and situations. Backwards compatibility may not be maintained.


## Ways to use Omes
Omes can be executed in three ways:
1. Create a worker and run a scenario in the same execution thread
    - This is good for basic bench-marking
2. Create a worker and run a scenario in separate execution threads
3. Remove test data

## Create a logs folder
Create a logs folder where we can put the omes scenario logs
```bash
mkdir ../logs
```


## Basic Omes usage
We'll start by exploring a basic Omes run:

```bash
go run ./cmd run-scenario-with-worker \
    --scenario state_transitions_steady \
    --language go \
    --duration 2m \
    --option state-transitions-per-second=30 \
    --run-id state-transitions-test-run \
    &> ../logs/state_transitions_steady.log
```

### Discussion 1
1. What is the contraint of this approach? Why is this considered the entry level usage?
2. Review the logs then your grafana dashboards, what do you notice?


## Removing Omes scenario test data
```bash
go run ./cmd cleanup-scenario --scenario state_transitions_steady --run-id state-transitions-test-run
```
