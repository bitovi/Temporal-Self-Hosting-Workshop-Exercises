# 4.1: Clean-up
Let's now clean up our cluster from the benchmarking.

## Before we begin let's clean out all the test data we just generated

Use the Temporal CLI to delete the **default** namespace. Afterwards run

```bash
kubectl delete pod $(kubectl get pods | grep my-temporal-history | awk '{print $1}')
```

Recreate the namespace once the History service refreshes and then reset the workers:

```bash
kubectl delete pod $(kubectl get pods | grep benchmark-workers | awk '{print $1}')
```
