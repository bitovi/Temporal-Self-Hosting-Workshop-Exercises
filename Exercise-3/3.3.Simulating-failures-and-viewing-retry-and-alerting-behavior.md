# 4.3: Simulating failures and viewing retry and alerting behavior

In our last exercise we took time to read through the first responder dashboard: **Temporal Server Metrics**. This should always be the first place we look when we want to begin diagnosing or investigating our Temporal service health and performance.


## Exercise setup
In your Grafana UI, on the top right click the down pointing arrow beside the refresh button, in the dropdown menu select **auto**. To the left of that ensure the timescale selected is **Last 5 minutes**.


## Exercise 1 - Create an alert
Let's begin by creating  Prometheus alert that will sound off when our system performance becomes degragaded. Prometheus alerts aren't a fully-fledged notfication solution but it does provide a warning for operators when something in their self-hosted Temporal service isn't right.


1. In the left hand panel open the **Alerting > Alert Rules**
2. On the top right click the **New Alert Rule** button
3. Enter the alert rule name:  **Service Availability below 75%**
4. In the define query and alert condition
    - Select **code** and paste the following: `100 - (sum(rate(service_errors[2m]) OR on() vector(0)) / sum(rate(service_requests[2m])) * 100)`
    - Click **Options** and change Time Range to `now-1m to now`, Max data points to `43200` and interval to `1s`
5. Within the expressions tab
     - Within the **B Reduce** panel, remove the **B Reduce** panel by clicking the garbage can on the right
     - Within the **C Threshold** panel, update the input to A, update the **IS ABOVE** evaluation to **IS BELOW** and set the value to 75
6. Within the **Set evaluation behavior** tab
    - Click `+ New folder` and give it the name `Service_Availability`
    - Click `+ New evaluation group` and give it the name `Service_Availability_Group`, Set the Evaluation interval to 10s
7. Within the **Configure label and notifications** tab
    - Set the **Contact point** to `grafana-default-email`
8. On the top right click `Save rule and exit`


This rule will watch the same value as the **Temporal Server Metrics dashboard > Service Availability** panel, if the value drops below 75% it will trigger this alert. Within the **Alerting > Alert Rules** open up the `Service_Availability > Service_Availability_Group`, you can see our newly created rule and assuming your Temporal service is stable and running, we will see the tags `1 normal | 10s`.

Let's now break some things and see how our dashboards respond!


## Exercise 2 - Simulate Pod Disruption

```bash
kubectl scale deployment <deployment> --replicas=0
```
