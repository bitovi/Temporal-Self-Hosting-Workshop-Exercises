# 4.4 Additional Metrics
Based on the hands-on work that Bitovi has done and our friendly communication channels with Temporal we've collected additional metrics that we believe are worth adding to the observability layer.

Add these additional metrics to your observability dashboards to expand on your available insights. We've made this easy by creating a managed JSON file with everything you need.

1. Navigate to the admin tab > Users and Access panel
2. Create service account (call it admin) and give it `role: editor` permissions
3. Create service account token and copy it to clipboard
4. Replace <bearer-token> with the service account token
5. Apply the bitovi-expanded-dashboard.json via the API endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST "localhost:3000/api/dashboards/db" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <bearer-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @bitovi-expanded-dashboard.json
```

I'd also like to point participants to the Temporal youtube channel's [Observability for Self-Hosted Temporal: Performance, Troubleshooting, and Optimization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkcXlfrzu6U) talk which points out even more metrics worth keeping an eye on as you scale your self-hosted service.
